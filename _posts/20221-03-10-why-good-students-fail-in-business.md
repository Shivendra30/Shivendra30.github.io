How Being a Good Student Harmed My Entrepreneurial Success

### The “A-student” mindset you need to change to make it as an entrepreneur

I was the typical A student. No, I’ve not been good at studies since birth, but the year I turned 14, I started taking my grades seriously. I saw how the life of the top-achievers in my class was radically different than mine.

I wanted that. I wanted all the benefits that come with scoring well — being treated nicely by teachers and classmates, getting into a good college, being a part of the student body council, and so on.

But in hindsight, there are notable pitfalls I could’ve avoided. Perhaps, the biggest one was adopting the attitude of an “A-student.” Scoring well on exams is fine. Having intelligence is no problem. But there are certain traits of good students that prevent them from business success.

I saw these bottlenecks firsthand when I start my own business in my first year of college. I was proud of being admitted into the best commerce college in the country. I studied accounting, business law, entrepreneurship, marketing, HR, and numerous other skills that seemed important in “real life.” Naturally, business was something I could excel at — or so I thought.

When I started my own company, as you might guess, I got punched in the face by the market a lot of times. But thank God for those early failures that made me realize my negative tendencies.

When I started again the next time, I applied all those lessons and was able to do much better than before. Yet, all this time, not only did I learn from my experience, but also from the experience of other “intelligent” friends that embarked on their entrepreneurial journey.

And so after spending a couple of years in business, it was clear to me why classroom success doesn’t lead to business success.

## Beginner’s Mind is Lost In The Sea of Intelligence
> # “I know that I know nothing.” — Socrates

A-students have learned a lot in their short lives. Most of it may be useless, but they did spend hours and years learning it.

Coming from that place, it’s natural to feel that you know a lot. But when you think you don’t need to learn anything else, that’s the beginning of your end.

When the beginner's mindset is lost, you don’t learn new things. You become lazy. You’re not on your toes anymore. The industry slips from your hands and so does your business.

Think about how much business has changed in the past 20 years. The rate of change is only increasing. One year you have COVID, another year you see new apps like TikTok and Clubhouse pop up. There’s no scope of letting your guard down.

Once upon a time, ice was cut only from places like frozen lakes and so on. A few years later people started freezing ice in factories and delivering it to people. And then a few years later, we had the refrigerator.

The funny thing is — no ice-harvesting company became an ice-freezing company. And no ice-freezing company became a refrigerator company.

It takes a beginner’s mindset to see these changes and adapt to them. And it’s not easy, especially for the ones who consider themselves super-intelligent.

You’ve to avoid letting your identity getting trapped in your intelligence. When you enjoy being the smartest person in the room, you’re in deep trouble. Learn to see this as a flaw in your attitude and change it before it harms you.

## Too Conservative

Due to the environment they’re brought up in, A-students are accustomed to certainty. This is one of the biggest personal challenges I faced early on in entrepreneurship.

The education system is straightforward —Study a few chapters and you can score a certain percentage for sure. If you score a certain percentage, you’re guaranteed to pass. When you score well, everyone around you is happy and life is good.

Alas, the business world is not as simple as that. You never see the whole path in front of you. You have to have faith and take it one step at a time.

Back when I worked with clients in the retail industry, I never knew exactly how we’ll build the software they needed. I wasn’t sure if other businesses would buy that product.

Again, when I started writing online I never knew I could reach this far. I never knew how I’d write hundreds of articles, what courses and products I’ll offer and who would buy them.

I had to trust the process and keep putting in the work. And also instill the same faith in my team and investors. A-students cringe at the sign of uncertainty, but if you want to have the slightest success in business, you need to be comfortable with it.

## Overestimation of Strengths

People trust people who deliver.

It’s true in every industry. If I write a clickbait headline and don’t offer my readers the value I promised, they’d never read my work nor support me in the future.

The problem with being an A-student is you’re immersed in your grandeur. You think just like you aced your exams, everything will go according to plan and you’ll deliver the most awesome outcome the world has ever seen.

Preoccupation with your skills can cast a veil on your eyes leading you to make promises you can’t fulfill. And when you over promise and under deliver, you lose before you even start the game.

No one prefers to work with a person who can’t deliver, no matter which university they come from.

## Entitlement Mentality

Smart people often think that just because they put in hours of work or their idea was great or their parents have the right connections, they deserve success. This cannot be further from the truth. Yes, all those things help. But they don’t guarantee anything.

If success was all about hard work, it would not be scalable. You can only work 18 hours a day until you die working.

The successful ones learn the rules of the game early on. These include strategy, investing in the right people and assets, business models, cash flow, delegation, leadership, team-building, and a bunch of other things that escape me at the moment.

You don’t deserve anything. The market doesn’t owe you a dime.

If you give value, you will receive value. No one cares how much you worked or how much you spend to deliver the results. The result is what counts.

## Difficult to Play With

Since A-students are used to being on the top a skill that doesn’t require any teamwork (studying), they’re often hard-headed. It’s always “my way,” and no “high way.” They can rarely be the bigger person.

Their ego comes in the way of admitting mistakes and giving shady justifications for them. Know this — the best way to solve an argument is to apologize and admit that it’s your fault.

No matter how good you are at what you do, if you can’t work in a team, you’ll have a very tough time.

## Know-It-All

Napolean Hill in his famous classic [*Think and Grow Rich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30186948-think-and-grow-rich)* tells a fascinating tale from the life of Henry Ford.

During WW1 Henry Ford sued a Chicago newspaper for libeling him when they called him “an ignorant pacifist.” At the ensuing trial, the defense lawyers grilled Mr. Ford with a line of questioning regarding general knowledge in an effort to prove to the jury that he was, as they said, ignorant.

Ford said something iconic:
> “If I should really want to answer the foolish question you have just asked, or any of the other questions you have been asking me, let me remind you that I have a row of electric push-buttons on my desk, and by pushing the right button, I can summon to my aid men who can answer any question I desire to ask concerning the business to which I am devoting most of my efforts. Now, will you kindly tell me, why I should clutter up my mind with general knowledge, for the purpose of being able to answer questions, when I have men around me who can supply any knowledge I require?”

The funny thing is, before starting any business, I’d read this story at least thrice, but the lesson still didn’t register in my head — i.e, the importance of building a great team.

When I failed to get one of my ideas off-ground, I approached one of the alums of my college who was killing it with his own startup. Being from a background in business education, I asked him how he manages to run a gaming company pioneering in HTML5 games.
> “Who’s the CTO?” I asked. He told me simply — “I am.” “But…you’re from my college. No one teaches it here?” I followed up childishly.

He was humble enough to give me one of the best lessons I’d received — find (and hire) people who’re way smarter than you. You’ll learn enough from them to manage the processes while they create the awesome tech product (or whatever your goal is).

As I took this advice to heart, me and my co-founder honestly divided our responsibilities according to our strengths. Further, we always approached experts to learn from (if not hire) whenever faced with a problem.

Most of the “savvy” entrepreneurs are good at this one skill. Name any successful business person and you’ll see a team of experts behind their success. These experts tend to include lawyers, accountants, financiers, bankers, marketers, writers, public relations pros, scientists, programmers, and so on.

As I said, the concept of teamwork is usually absent from an A-student’s dictionary. They have a hard time seeing someone do better than them which puts the future of their business in jeopardy.

## Final Thoughts

These were only some top-of-the-head reasons why I’ve seen students not make it big in the startup/business world.

The good news is that with some training and introspection, these mindsets can be changed. How to do it? By spending time with other entrepreneurs who’ve achieved what you want.

They can save you from serious mistakes on your part and catch your biases before you do.

We A-students are great in many ways. Let’s not fall prey to our intelligence and kill our business dreams!
