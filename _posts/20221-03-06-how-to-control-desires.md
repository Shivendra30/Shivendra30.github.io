> # “What is it that draws me, even against my will, into delusion? What is that force?”

…Arjuna desperately asks Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. That, in fact, is a question that we all would like to know the answer to. After all, we all are good human beings that want to do well for ourselves and others.

Then why is it so that the outcomes don’t match our intention? Why is it that even if we try to succeed, we’re pulled downward by a force? What is that force?

Krishna replies, “It is the power of desire and anger, impelled by rajo guna.” A “guna” means a quality. According to the yogic teachings and that of the Gita, everything in this world is endowered with the presence of the three gunas.

The first is Sattva guna. It’s the quality that leads us to aspire for truth, encourage in our inner search, and moves us closer to inner happiness. The second is Rajo guna, the activating force in our nature. It keeps us restless to always reach someplace. It leads us to focus outward to get the happiness we need — through the mind and the senses. The third is Tamo guna, the downward-pulling energy that darkens our consciousness and hinds us to anger, greed, lust, violence, etc.

In this context, every person has the three Gunas imbibed in their nature. The attitude of the person is determined by which guna has a stronger influence. If the Sattva guna is more active, you’ll be peaceful, calm, and moving happily on the path of Self-realisation. If the Tamo guna is active, you’ll indulge in activities that lower your [consciousness](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/the-answer-to-the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-3c706e1410ce).

Rajo guna further has two aspects — the Sattva-Rajo and the Tamo-Rajo. As the name states, when the Rajo guna creates a desire in a person to aspire for truth and be more Sattvic, it’s the play of the Sattva-Rajo.

However, it can very well lead you in the opposite direction of Tamo-Rajo. This is where the rajo guna creates desires that push you downward and commit deeds that you know you shouldn’t.

Since we’re being pulled by desires all day long, we need to pay attention to how we can effectively control them. The price of poor desire management can be enormous. Public health [statistics](https://galileo.seas.harvard.edu/images/material/2800/1140/McGinnis_ActualCausesofDeathintheUnitedStates.pdf) show that 40 percent of deaths in the U.S. each year are associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as unhealthy food, smoking, alcohol, unprotected sex, and illicit drugs.

It’s a moment-to-moment conflict between our higher nature and our lower nature. Between our immediate desires (e.g., tasty food, alcoholic drinks, sexual interactions) and upholding virtue through self-control (e.g., maintaining one’s weight, not driving drunk, staying faithful).

## How Do Desires Emerge?

Scientifically speaking, desires emerge in a relatively automatic manner. The brain’s reward systems evaluate external stimuli against the background of internal need states (e.g., hunger, craving, or feeling lonely) and an individual’s learning history.

Let’s say you were feeling sad one fine afternoon and you decided to eat a piece of chocolate. Consequently, you felt better. Whether it was the taste itself or the sugar rush it gave you, doesn’t matter. The desire has been planted.

The next time you feel sad, there will automatically be a desire to eat chocolate. The more you repeat this, the harder it becomes to break the loop. Also, the more automatic your desire becomes. The time between feeling sad and reaching out for chocolate will keep on decreasing.

If the desire is strong enough, it can play havoc on your mind. Tell me if this sounds familiar — “*I’ve not had a dessert in a long time. This is the last one I allow myself to have, before I start my diet.”* In this case, the desire for the chocolate was so strong that all the other goals went for a toss.

The ability to resist desires simply depends on two things — **the strength of the desire and the strength of your self-control**. Both these variables are different for everyone. Empirically, the stronger the desire gets, the stronger your self-control and willpower should be to overcome it. (Yes, there are ways to hack willpower, but a baseline level of self-control is required in any case).

That said, the question is how can we tackle these desires to ensure that we move in the right direction? Here are a few ways that can help.

## The Number One Willpower Hack of All Time

“Out of sight, out of mind” is the rule I follow religiously whenever I set to eradicate a bad habit from my life. Most desires emerge from our environment and visual cues.

So the goal is simple — **do everything to limit your exposure to temptations. **Avoid it like a plague and don’t touch it even with a ten-foot pole. This strategy works brilliantly for tons of scenarios.

Let me take a personal example. I don’t watch TV a lot. I may watch it once a day while having lunch. But the problem, as you know, is it can quickly turn into 30 minutes or even an hour if I’m seeing something exciting. Now, **if I hire you as a personal habit coach, what would you do?** Think hard before you read on.

Done brainstorming? Great. Here’s what I’d do:

* Forget all Wi-Fi connections in my TV so I’d have to connect to them again.

* Take the cells out of the remote. Keep the cells and the remote at two different places.

* Mount the TV off or keep it in some other room.

* Give the remote to someone in my family who’s headed out for the day.

* Cancel my OTT subscriptions to Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sony Liv (in India), etc.

* Block the same websites on my laptop using [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com/)

After implementing some or all of these, I’d replace that with a podcast, audiobook, informational videos, or just have my lunch in peace while I savor every bite like it’s the last one.

If you’re struggling with a bad habit of having sweetmeats, throw them out of the house. Don’t linger over cooking channels and/or watch others eat them! Maybe unsubscribe from all the dessert-related Instagram profiles and YouTube channels.

All this might seem a little extreme. But what can I say? Desires often crop up without us knowing. By the time they surface in our working memory or our conscious mind, they’ve gained substantial strength.

You may say, “There’s no harm in thinking!” but there’s every harm. The thought is how everything in the Universe begins. Today you think about it. Tomorrow you’ll think about how. And the day after the deed will be done! Beware.

## Look Out for the ‘Rebound Effect’

Often when faced with desires, we try to suppress them or the thought that leads us to it. It’s the act of trying to force the unwanted information out of your awareness. By doing this, however, **you’re only giving that thought more energy, even if it’s in the form of denial**. It’s like sinking a cork in water — the issue won’t go away.

In a classic [experiment](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/10/unwanted-thoughts), when the subjects were asked not to think about a white bear for a few minutes, they failed to suppress their thought about a white bear. The white bear doesn’t go away. It keeps intruding into your thought, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as a **rebound effect**.

Or you can simply understand this by the age-old adage — “**what you resist not only persists but will grow in size.**” The more you think about not having the cookie, the more you’d want to have it.

**The solution is to accept**. Cravings and temptations are just temporary states of mind. Accepting, insteaad of suppressing them helps you detach from the desire.

Instead of telling yourself “No I won’t eat that cookie!” try saying “I’m having a momentary desire to eat a cookie. I don’t have to act on it.” Naturally, your mind will find something else to think about if you don’t cling to the thought of the cookie by suppressing it.

## Conscious Redirection

Just as the name suggests, as soon as you become aware of an unwanted desire, direct your attention somewhere else. If you want to eat the cookie, listen to some music instead. Call up a friend. Talk to someone. Watch a movie. Whatever it is that you do, try to distract yourself from that thought. Be conscious of not suppressing it though. Accept it, and then turn away.

## Cognitive Reframing

The reason a temptation seems tempting is your reaction to it. The cookie may make a person vomit. But you like it because you think it will give you satisfaction.

Since this attraction is the deed of your mind, you can engage in an **abstract de-valuation of the temptation**. For instance, in [*On Desire: Why We Want What We Want](https://www.amazon.com/Desire-Why-We-Want-What/dp/0195327071/)*, William Irvine (2006) relates advice provided by a Buddhist monk on how to deal with tantalizing sexual desire by thinking about the human body in less favorable terms: “Don’t think about her full breasts and flaxen hair; think instead about her lungs,… phlegm, pus, spittle.” (p187).

Consider what Marcus Aurelius has to [say](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8395175-how-good-it-is-when-you-have-roast-meat-or) on the same lines:
> “And in sexual intercourse that it is no more than the friction of a membrane and a spurt of mucus ejected. **How good these perceptions are at getting to the heart of the real thing and penetrating through it, so you can see it for what it is!**
> “This should be your practice throughout all your life: when things have such a plausible appearance, **show them naked, see their shoddiness, strip away their own boastful account of themselves**.
> “Vanity is the greatest seducer of reason: when you are most convinced that your work is important, that is when you are most under its spell.”

You can similarly focus on the negative side of eating the cookie — consuming too many calories, not reaching your fitness goal, being shamed by others, letting yourself down in your own eyes, etc. You can exaggerate it as much as you like for the act of liking or disliking both exist in our minds alone.

Cognitive reframing is an indispensable tool to disarm the temptation of its enticing benefits.

## Watch Your Thoughts

Desires, as I said, emerge secretly. You don’t know when they plant a seed in your subconscious mind. You may think you’re doing well on your diet when suddenly you see a picture of your friend having your favorite dessert at your favorite place. This is the best time to counter the desire.

When the desire for breaking your diet emerges, tell yourself — “The dessert tastes good, but I have different goals that I’m aspiring towards. I’d rather be healthy than giving in to momentary pleasure.” Kill the desire as close to its roots as possible

The only challenge with this exercise is the awareness and mindfulness it requires. Don’t fret, this can also be cultivated with a regular practice of meditation and other mindful exercises like [mindful eating](https://medium.com/the-ascent/mindful-eating-101-the-complete-beginners-guide-fc85ec8d5afe), walking, and so on.

## Simplify Your Life

Desires for name, fame, power, money, material possessions are just a few that tempt all of us into misery. To reduce the overall number of desires in your life, simplify.

The process of simplification, for me, is an affirmation that I don’t need the “unnecessary necessities” to live a happy life. I don’t need a car to impress others, the shiny shoes that attract attention, or the best hair product that makes my hair glow.

When you start to live a simple life, you get clear on what you want from life. You can finally make time to focus on the Sattva-Rajasic desires that help you [grow as a human being](https://medium.com/the-ascent/why-minimalism-makes-people-happy-and-grows-exponentially-81ca808a944).

## Train Your Concentration

Half the trouble with desires is caused by [constant mind-wandering](https://medium.com/the-ascent/harvard-psychologists-tell-us-how-were-killing-our-happiness-94e0e478eea2). To stop this, we’ve to learn to train the mind to concentrate fully on what we’re doing on a moment-to-moment basis.

Instead of thinking about having the left-over cake in your refrigerator, focus on writing that draft, finishing that presentation, or finalizing that design.

The more you can train your concentration, the easier it becomes to tackle desires. For concentration is nothing but being able to focus on something one-pointedly. Once you have the ability to do that, you can do wonders in a world of distracted zombies (let’s be honest!)

## Raise Your Consciousness
> # He who forsakes desires for lesser enjoyments, unattached to sense objects, devoid of the consciousness of ‘me and mine,’ receives the lasting joy of God-peace
> # — Krishna, Bhagvad Gita

Raising your consciousness is the surest way to eliminate desires. Desires keep our energy focused on delusion. By desiring something we say, “I’ll be happy when I have X.” Well if you’re not happy in the process, how are you going to get whatever you want? And even when you get there, you’ll find that the happiness gained is transient.

Then you’ll have another desire. This cycle continues for lifetimes until we consciously break it. When you [raise your consciousness](https://medium.com/the-ascent/how-to-raise-your-consciousness-with-the-spiritual-eye-e1588b5ac0cf) and find happiness *within*, you’re less and less affected by the outcome of what happens *without*. Your desires reduce.

You may still have preferences. But you stop placing conditions on your happiness. Unplugging yourself from those desires is what true freedom is about.

## Final Thoughts

Controlling desires is a practice of a lifetime. You can’t expect to get good at it instantly. Even though you’ll be able to have fewer desires, they will emerge endlessly.

You have to constantly be on the lookout. Don’t merely think that controlling a few desires here and there makes you a master of self-control. Attack them from all directions — meditation, concentration, change in environment, etc — and you’ll surely find success.

Here are all the different ways you can use to control your desires:

1. **Change your environment to prevent relapse**. Remember — “Out of sight, out of mind”

1. **Accept the temptations, don’t resist them**, for they’d only rebound to come back stronger

1. **Consciously redirect your attention** to something else

1. Strip the desire off of its attraction by **cognitive reframing**

1. Start the practice of **watching your thoughts** and kill desires when they arise

1. **Simplify your life** to avoid developing new, useless desires for material objects

1. **Train your concentration **to focus one-pointedly on anything you’re doing

1. **Raise your consciousness** to find happiness within therefore making desires less enticing

I’ll end with a quote by [Swami Sri Yukteswar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Sri_Yukteswar_Giri) in [Autobiography of a Yogi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/639864.Autobiography_of_a_Yogi):
> # “The forceful activating impulse of wrong desire is the greatest enemy of the happiness of man. Roam in the world as a lion of self-control, see that the frogs of weakness don’t kick you around.”
