How to Bring Mindfulness to the Gym for Relaxed Results

### And change your exercise experience in the process

About a trillion studies have shown that a combination of cardio and strength training is good for us. Whether it’s stress, weight loss, depression, or keeping diseases at bay, exercise is one of the best remedies.

The problem is that gyms can be intimidating. When I first joined a gym, I didn’t know a thing about strength training. All I’d ever done was run in the local park.

To gain some confidence, I’d prepared myself by thoroughly watching YouTube videos — that’s the best I could do. The moment I stepped into the gym, I was more confused than ever. I took to a treadmill in the corner as my comfortable cocoon. As time passed, hesitatingly, I decided to go forward and started using the cables.

As soon as I started replicating the movements I’d seen on a video, a trainer came and told me that I’m doing it wrong. To be honest, I was a little terrified of making a fool of myself.

Day by day, I started getting better with training. My body was improving. But my mind was at the same place. I still had my insecurities every time I saw others who lifted heavier or were slimmer than me.

## The Mind-Set Shift

Almost a year after I started going to the gym, I stumbled upon [meditation](http://reinventyourself.biz/what-is-meditation/). My morning routine was simple — get up, meditate, exercise, and head to college/work.

As I started meditating in tandem with exercising every morning, I couldn’t help but notice certain changes that I was going through. My workouts were the same, and my lifts were getting better at a steady rate — but more importantly my mind was changing.

I realized that I was being more mindful of my form, and of others around me. I had lesser insecurities and comparisons running through my mind. My only focus was on doing the best I could.

Impressed by this change, I started to investigate the lovely combination of mindfulness and exercise. I found many of the best bodybuilders in the world used mindfulness to build more muscle. And at the same time, I discovered how I can bring attitudes like kindness and compassion to the gym.

Combined, all these attitudes changed my workout experience forever and helped me achieve better results without going crazy in the process.

## How Dorian Yates Went Against Conventional Wisdom and Succeeded

Dorian Yates reached the epitome of success in bodybuilding. He won Mr. Olympia six consecutive times from 1992 to 1997 and is remembered with legendary bodybuilders like Ronnie Coleman, Arnold, and Phil Health. What’s fascinating about Dorian Yates is this:

Dorian trained for 45 minutes, four times a week for Mr. Olympia. This routine, as [Ben Pakulski](https://reinventyourself.biz/life-lessons-yogi-bodybuilder) [says](https://londonreal.tv/ben-pakulski-the-bodybuilding-yogi-how-to-unify-the-mind-body/), was unheard of. While a lot of folks trained every day, and some twice a day, Dorian believed in quality workouts and rest.

You may be thinking how was Dorian able to get away with fewer sessions and still defeat his competitors? Perhaps a better question is,
> # What did he do to increase the quality of his workouts?

He was mindful.

Believe it or not, mindfulness is an important part of fitness, especially when it comes to strength training. As Ben Pakulski teaches, the aim of a workout is not to lift the heaviest weight you can. Yes, you should aim higher and increase the weight over time. But in the short term, the goal is to challenge the muscle.

Imagine how you’d challenge your bicep. You’ll probably lift a moderate amount of weight, isolate your bicep by putting your elbow on your knee and curl your arm to lift it.

It’s that simple. But when it comes to doing it, we forget the fundamentals.
We focus on how much weight others are lifting around us. We try to impress others by the weight of our dumbells rather than our actual growth. Why? Because it feels good in the short term.

In the long run, it is a waste of time since it will not give you the results you desire. The best way to fix this is to **meditate on the muscle.**

It means being fully aware of the muscle you’re targeting. Consciously contract and expand the muscle that you’re working and see the benefits yourself.

This automatically fixes your form and avoids the risk of injury. Moreover, you’re much less likely to use momentum to complete your reps. When you put this into practice, you’ll not be able to lift as much weight. But over time, you’ll find your muscles growing much faster.

## Beware of Music
> # “I don’t listen to music when I lift. I don’t listen to music before I go out for WWE, either.” — John Cena

Listening to music is almost a requirement for most lifters. And I get it. It helps to release dopamine in the brain to improve performance. But I’d beg to differ. Listening to music, at the cost of being mindful, is not beneficial.

You see gym rats putting on earplugs and doing all sorts of crazy movements. They lift weights as if dancing to beats. This is self-defeating.

You’re much less likely to focus on your form when you’re blasting heavy metal in your ears. Instead, consider giving it up altogether or listen to beats that are not exciting.

You may be bored for a couple of days but you only need a little practice of mindful lifting. After a few days, you’ll stop missing the beats.

Instead of focusing on the TV, or the music, try to bring your attention to your body. If you’re lifting, feel the burn or the heaviness of the lift. If you’re running, feel your feet hitting the floor and your muscles contracting and expanding. Bring your attention back to the moment.

## The 3-Step Checklist to Use Before Every Rep

When I heard ‘meditate on the muscle’ it wasn’t completely obvious to me as to how I’d implement it in reality. Yes, greater awareness is something we all can cultivate but you still need a plan to go ahead. Here’s a simple checklist you should keep in mind before starting every rep:

* **Setup** your body with proper form

* **Stabilize** to lift the weight with the muscle and not momentum

* **Initiate** the movement with the muscle you’re training

Thinking about the checklist forces you to pay attention to the different components of each rep thereby making you much more mindful of what you’re doing.

## Cultivating Compassion

One of the surest ways to feel bad about yourself is to compare yourself with others. When I used to go running, there was always one guy who passed me many times. He ran circles around me even though I was trying my best.

Comparing his progress to mine ruined the whole joy of running. It’s silly, but when your insecurities come to your mind, your mood can change in an instant. This situation amplified in the gym where I was one of the weakest members at the start.

[Compassion and kindness](https://medium.com/the-ascent/the-most-overlooked-aspect-of-meditation-is-not-what-you-think-c732db999adf) are one of the basic pillars of every spiritual philosophy. No philosophy ever said, “Children, for a change, be unkind and ruthless.”

So when I bring the same emotion into my daily life and workouts, I stop my wandering mind from thinking “How weak I am!” Instead, I think “Wow! That guy sure is strong! I hope he keeps on progressing like this.”

Compassion is the balm that cures the disease of judgment. When compassion flows from your heart, you can neither judge others nor judge yourself. The judgment is replaced by calm acceptance of everything.

When you learn to bless everything and everyone you see, the gym and the world becomes a much better place to live in.

## Doing Body Scans

When I take a rest after doing a set, I try to do a body scan instead of thinking about how hard it is.

I take a couple of deep breaths and then bring my attention to my breath — just as an observer, not controlling it. As I become calmer, I focus on the muscle I’m training.

If I’m doing a squat, for example, I focus on my feet for some time, then my calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes, and so on.

When we get tired, our form usually takes a hit. By being in touch with your body throughout the session, you can maintain proper form and avoid injury while taking your mind away from fatigue.

## Final Thoughts

Mindfulness was never meant to stop at the cushion. You need to [carry your mindfulness](https://reinventyourself.biz/improve-your-meditation-practice/) with you to see its magic unfold.

Take note of your energy levels and mood when you work out. Set your intention. Notice the changes in your breath and heart rates. Be grateful to have a body well enough to move and be compassionate to others.

These are all little ways to bring mindfulness to the gym and have a serene workout experience like never before!
