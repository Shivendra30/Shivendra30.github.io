I am a commerce student at Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University, passionate about making products and building businesses. I'm highly interested in upcoming technologies and the business opportunities that follow. I am skilled in Android, Javascript, HTML,CSS, React, and Node.js. Apart from that, I like sharing my thoughts with like-minded people through speaking and writing on my blog. Have something interesting to work on? Let's collaborate!
